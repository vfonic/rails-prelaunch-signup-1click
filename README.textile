h1. This is a fork of the excellent "Rails Prelaunch Signup":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-prelaunch-signup project

by "DanielKehoe":https://github.com/DanielKehoe

This fork reduces the steps needed to capture an email address. 

The notable differences:
* No more modals: Email capture is moved to the primary landing page (instead of a secondary modal)
* Design tweaks: Seems everyone wants a giant headline these days. Added copy placeholders.
* Does not use social sharing buttons (might add later)
* Uses erb instead of haml (but not all pages converted to erb)

Notes:
* I'm not going to win any coding challenge awards (n00b), so proceed with caution. You'll find a few hacks in here, but most are labeled as such.
* If you want ongoing support, I strongly recommend you fork the "original project":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-prelaunch-signup and merge in my additions
